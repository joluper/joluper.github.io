## About

My name is José Luis Pérez. I am curious by nature and I enjoy learning and researching topics mainly related to cybersecurity and hardware hacking.

My hobbies are computer science, photography and nature. I like to share knowledge and meet new people willing to create community and share experiences.

Curently I am interested in advanced data revcovery, electronics and personal development. I am doing my best to grow day by day learning new skills and techniques.

I also co-organize the NoONname Cybersecurity Congress and NCNlabs which are both hosted in Barcelona. [https://www.noconname.org/](https://www.noconname.org/)

If you want to know more about me, do not hesitate to get in touch!
