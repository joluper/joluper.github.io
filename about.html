## About

My name is José Luis Pérez. I am curious by nature and I enjoy learning and researching topics mainly related to cybersecurity and hardware hacking.

My hobbies are computer science, photography and nature. I like to share knowledge and meet new people willing to create community and share experiences.

That's me, well, a summary of me ;)
